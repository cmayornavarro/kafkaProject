- events writed in logs
- kafka manages logs 
- topic : collections of logs
- topics stored data for a short period of time or indefiniteley
- each events has data happening in the entreprise
- applications can communcates with kafka
- kafka helps getting data in and out


Event : thing that has happened . It's a notification. 
	- changes
	- user interaction
	- microservice output
	
	- {key,value}: key identifier in the system and not an unique value

TOPICS

topic is like a table in a relational database
different topic for different events
for duplication, filtering data of another topic

topic = queue? topic = log of events
event are immutable so you cannot modify it or delete it

purge messages by size,date...
logs are saved in file system

PARTITIONING:
kafka is a distributed systems
brakes a topic in multiples subtopics
how to know which message to write to which partition?
if a message has no key then the messages are distributed randomly to partitions.
If a message has a key, we know where kafka puts the message. messages having the same key are always in the same partition so the order is respected.
